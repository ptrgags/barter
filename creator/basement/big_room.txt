<p>You are in a big room with many doors. The music is getting louder.</p>

<p>On the left wall, there are two doors. The closer one just has a doorknob,
the other one has a keyhole</p>

<p>On the far wall, there is a single door marked "Laundry"</p> 

<p>On the the right wall, there are again two doors. The closer one has
a numeric keypad. The farther one is unmarked</p>

<p>Other than this, the room is empty.</p>
